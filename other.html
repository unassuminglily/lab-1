        <h2>Through <em>my</em> lookingglass</h2>
        <p>If you made your way here you might as well sit down with a cup of any soothing beverage of your choice. I have too many interests to remember them all for listing. It's a blessing because I have the drive to learn and master many areas however,
            sometimes it can honestly be a <strong>pain</strong>.<br> I'm going to try and categorise all my interests here. If that's not what ends up being on the page, I tried but at least you'll learn a bit more about me and what drives me.

        <h2><em>My Faith✨</em></h2>
        <p>I'm a Christian. One of the best decisions I made for myself to be honest. I spend a lot of time building my faith and I'll leave my current favourite quote here.
        </p>
        <blockquote>“Let everything about you be a lie, but let this word of God be true. The devil will say you are the driest person and that you will never do anything, but you believe God's word, that the anointing which ye have received of Him abideth in you.”
            Smith Wigglesworth

        <h2><em>People👪</em></h2>
        <p> People inspire me, people intrigue, people scare me.</p>
        <p>I used to be an introvert, people even used to call me anti-social. Growing up, it was hard to relate with my peers but I eventually overcame those barriers and since then I've loved to connect with people, talk to them, listen to them and inspire
            them. That's the reason why I'm a peer coach and tutor.

        <h2><em>Technology💻</em></h2>
        <p>If there's one thing that fascinates me it's technology, particularly technology in design.</p>
        <p>I just love the idea of how you can create aethetic and accessible things for a wide range of users. That's why I like UI and web design. Two things I'm absolutely determined to master
