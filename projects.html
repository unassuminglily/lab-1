                A database management system for a fraternity house
            </summary>
            <p>I created designed and created a DBMS using the following imaginary case study for my Database Management Class:</p>
            <p>The Student Life and Engagement Unit provides direct developmental services to enhance the student experience and is in charge of promoting a positive residence life. Due to the increasing number of students being admitted on-campus, the SLE
                is planning on building fraternity houses instead of residential houses to improve student experience. The SLE thus needs an efficient database management system to control and organise the running of the fraternity houses to make them
                uniquely and efficiently tailored to enhance residential life and inclusivity.</p>
            <p>Some functionalities of the DBMS includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storing a record on the details of all 3 fraternity houses</li>
                <li>A record of all applicants</li>
                <li>A record of students admitted into fraternity houses</li>
                <li> A record of all alumni of the fraternity houses</li>
            </ul>

                A python program which receives a location and displays it on a map
            </summary>
            <p>In the Using Databases with Python course I took on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases/home/welcome">Coursera</a>, I completed a program which allowed a user to input a specific location and using an geographical location
                API, javascript and html, returned a visual representation of it on a map</p>

            <summary>
                A python program which spiders through a webpage and returns a visual of the embedded pages and their ranks
            </summary>
            <p>In the Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python course I took on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-visualization/home/welcome">Coursera</a>, I completed a program which allowed a user to spider through
                a web page, log all the urls found on that website and rank them. Finally, the javascript part of the program then visualises the ranks on nodes.</p>
