        <h2>Let's get to know each other!</h2>
        <p>
            “I want to be a star!” That’s what I remember saying the first time someone asked me what career path I wanted to pursue when older. I was laughed at and perhaps it was justified because I was way too young to understand what I was saying. It did leave a mark though, negative for most of my life and only becoming positive when I decided it could be.

            Pursuing an undergraduate degree in Management Information Systems was the first step. It was a choice I made because I wanted to go against the ideology surrounding education in my family and society as a whole.
            
            I’ve been called a philomath; because I love learning and my major allows me to have many opportunities to expand the breadth of my knowledge. I strive for excellence in any field I find myself in.
            
            Technology, people and design fascinate me. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, therefore, in any system built, I believe there must be elements of design that appeals to every user and gives a seamless experience.
            
            Outside learning, the next best place you’ll see me is talking to someone. I enjoy speaking and listening to people because it gives me the chance to have a share of different perspectives of life. As someone who grew up a self-proclaimed introvert I take it upon myself to break social constructs when possible with myself and with others.
            
            This comes in handy when I work as a freshman coach and peer tutor. The first step to moving forward in anything, I believe, is breaking out of the box your mind puts you in. I learnt this late and so I always go out of my way to inspire others to unleash their potential without limits.
            
            My core focuses of interest and skills currently include: web design/front end development, python programming, coaching and development.
            
            I would love to connect with you here on LinkedIn and hear your story.
